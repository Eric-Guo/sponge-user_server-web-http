description: Swagger/OpenAPI docs generation and serving
---
### Swagger / OpenAPI

- API docs metadata is declared in [cmd/user_server/main.go](mdc:cmd/user_server/main.go) with `@title`, `@version`, security schema, and host.
- Docs are served when `app.env != prod` at `/swagger/*any` in [internal/routers/routers.go](mdc:internal/routers/routers.go), after setting `docs.SwaggerInfo.BasePath = "/"`.
- Generate docs with:

```bash
make docs
```

- View docs at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`.
